## Architecture

Application spawns a webservice and bot is a separate service, both start together and are stopped together.

### Everything is a plugin

- Plugins are separated in two components, web and bot functionality, ipc communication is defined with a json schema (possibly), plugins are self contained and should be plug and play, an application restart is required to make them work.

## Features

  - Save in database
- Receive links via post, send to telegram
  - Save in database later (make configurable)
